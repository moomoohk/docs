cleaned up version of <a href=\"http://github.com/moomoohk/JGeekCode/\">JGeekCode</a> from Java.</p>\n<h2>Basic ideas</h2><ul><li>This library uses builders to generate the different categories that make up a Geek Code</li><li>Building a category is done by calling the <code>grade</code> method with a <code>GeekCodeGrade</code> or by calling some of the modifiers (i.e. <code>noKnowledge</code>) instead</li><li>The <code>geek_code</code> library includes a collection of base classes which are useful for implementing custom Geek Code flavors</li><li>The <code>geek_code.v312</code> library is an implementation of the Geek Code v3.12 specification (specified at http://geekcode.com/geek.html), which is useful for generating a personal Geek Code</li></ul>\n<h2>Generating a Geek Code with <code>geek_code.v312</code></h2>\n<p>First you must import the library:</p>\n<pre><code>import \"package:geek_code/geek_code_312.dart\";\n</code></pre>\n<p>Start with a <code>GeekCodeV312</code> object that will contain all the types and categories:</p>\n<pre><code>GeekCodeV312 code = new GeekCodeV312([G312.IT, G312.CS]);\n</code></pre>\n<p>The above constructor receives a list of <code>GeekCodeType</code>s.</p>\n<p>Then add categories to the code object using the <code>addCategory(GeekCodeCategory)</code>.</p>\n<p>All v3.12 categories are globally defined by their code: </p>\n<pre><code>code.addCategory(C.grade(new GeekCodeGrade(2))); // Adds the C category (Computers) with a grade of 2 to the code\n</code></pre>\n<p>Generating a Geek Code block is done by callin <code>generate</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>print(code.generate());\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Variables and modifiers</h3>\n<p>As per the v3.12 specification it is possible to set certain modifiers for categories.</p>\n<pre><code>code.addCategory(h.living().grade(new GeekCodeGrade(-2))); // Adds the h category (Housing) with a grade of -2 and adds the \"living\" modifier to the code\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>Some modifiers are incompatible with each other:</p>\n<p>  code.addCategory(h.living().noKnowledge()); // Throws a GeekCodeError</p>\n<p>Some categories have specific modifiers so be sure to consult the documentation for each builder before using it.</p>\n<h3>Full example</h3>\n<pre><code>GeekCodeV312 code = new GeekCodeV312([G312.IT, G312.CS] as List&lt;GeekCodeType&gt;)\n  ..addCategory(d.crossover(new GeekCodeGrade(0)).living().grade(new GeekCodeGrade(-1)))\n  ..addCategory(s.roundness(new BasicGeekCodeCategoryBuilder().grade(new
